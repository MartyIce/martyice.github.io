Personal coding projects are the lifeblood of passionate software dev.  

I suppose everyone's got their own reason to write code - it may be a hobby, it may be a job, or something in between.  For me, however, it definitely scratches an itch.  A few different itches, actually, depending on what I'm coding.  UI work delights my inner artist, performance tuning gives me deep satisfaction, and bug fixing makes the world seem like a better place.  Usually most of these rewards are obtained in the course of a work (employed) day.  Coding for the man, fixing their things.  It's still a rewarding experience, but is constrained and dampened by the fact that it's not MINE.  I'm selling my time to someone else, caring for their baby.  

Creating your own projects takes this passion to the next level.

With your own project, you are the boss.  You decide the feature set, prioritize where time is spent, and weigh pros and cons.  I've found when working on my own I sometimes hear from the ghost of "am I allowed to do this?".  Should I add this feature in an incomplete state?  What if it's not ready?  Realizing that the decision is completely mine is a freeing feeling.  The decision is suddenly injected with a fun excitement, things seem more adventurous.  Mine!

This actually extends beyond the coding aspect of the project.  Suddenly aspects that are typically outside of my scope become mine to own.  Product feature decisions, Marketing and Sales.  I wonder what would sell?

One thing worth mentioning here is when money (revenue) is at stake, the decisions bear more weight.  I personally have never had my lifelihood depened oon the outcome of one of those personal decisions, and might feel more gravity if I had.  I hope someday to reach the point that I can make that type of decision.
