<h3>The Fateful Day</h3>
The past few months had been pretty rough at the candy factory.  Hell, the past few YEARS had been rough - lately it had been close to unbearable.  Aaryavir's helped build and maintain Dandy Candy's marketing website.  While he used to love the work, he was now in a downward spiral.  The whole company was struggling with morale.  Sales were down, heated emotions were up, and the future didn't look any better.  Management was starting to pound tables, looking for fixes and people to blame.  Heads were starting to roll.

One recent bright spot was the decision to revamp the marketing site.  Written 10 years ago in an old version of [Angular][angular], it was bad and getting worse.  It's styling looked antiquated, it was unusable in mobile, and few knew how to worth with its codebase.  Hiring had been very difficult lately, as no developers wanted to work on an antiquated relic.  

The last time a big change was introduced, it broke the checkout process.  And it took days to fix.  Deployed on a Friday afternoon, the lack of monitoring meant the problem went unnoticed for about a day.  It was Saturday afternoon before the [CRO][cro] noticed the lack of sales.  Frantic messaging ensued, followed by chaotic communication throughout the engineering organization.  The lead architect was finally tracked down, and found the problem after a few hours (lightspeed in this code base!).  The lengthy deployment process eventually fixed the problem Sunday afternoon.  The following Monday brought a shortened work week to several in the organization, as they were terminated.  The exhaused, abused morale of the company took another body blow.

In the days and weeks that followed, blame was found everywhere.  [DevOps][devops] rightly took a large share of it - the detection and fix for the issue took an inexcusable amount of time.  But as engineering dug into the problem, they gained a better appreciation of the dire state of the marketing site.  At first, short term fixes were discussed.  However, every potential avenue for improving the existing site ran into serious obstacles.  No automated testing.  Too much code debt.  Not enough talent.  Old platform.  Performance issues.  The list went on and on.  After a few grueling days of heated debate, the big decision was made - a rewrite would be occurring!

This was exciting news to the developers, and spirits soared as they began thinking ahead to the future.  Soon, however, discord began sinking in as different approaches were proposed.  Some championed [ReactJS][react], others [VueJS][vue].  Still others wanted to stick with [Angular][angular], by upgrading to the latest version (which was itself, a rewrite).  The temperature in the room seemed to rise with the heated debate.  Sleeves rolled up, armpits soaked with sweat.  The alpha coders in the organization dug in their heels, and each schemed how to undercut the other's justifications.  The pounding of tables escalated.

In the midst of this grandstanding, Aaryavir decided he'd had enough.  Ego was overtaking all reason, and a workable decision was receding into the distance.  He decided to take a chance, and spoke up.

"Has anyone here heard of [Svelte][svelte]?"

<h3>Thoughts & Notes</h3>
* For our hero's name, I grabbed the first one I saw [here][brave baby names].
* I've deliberately made this a "cliffhanger".  Both to build incredible suspense, and because I don't have the time and material to take this deeply yet.  Remains to be seen how I will approach the serial posting - perhaps alternate between Svelte love, and our story?
