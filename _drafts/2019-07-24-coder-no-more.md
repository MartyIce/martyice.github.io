The day has finally come.  In addition to graying hair, creaky joints, and degrading vision, I have accepted a "management" role at ECM (link).  My official title is Director of Software Development, and among other things, it means I'm not really supposed to be coding.  Pull requests I submit will be scorned, coding advice will be brushed aside, and my jokes will fall flat (more than usual).  I'm no longer one of the cool kids, slurping red bull and blasting hip music through my headphones all hours of the night.  I'm a slow, deliberately plodding manager.  An old guy.

I fought it for years.  From my early 20s on, I've resisted any offers to move into "lead" positions.  "I don't want to manage people".  "I just want to code".  Looking back, it *is* true that coding is my passion, and I wasn't excited about leaving that zone.  However, I think a big part of it was fear.  Imposter syndrome.  Reluctance to be a shot caller, to look stupid.  Now that I'm an old (44 years?!) man, some of that has subsided.  But much of the fear still remains.  I'm finally coming to realize that the fear itself isn't a reason to say no.  It's something to be challenged, explored, and overcome.  Growth!

This situation arose because my awesome manager was wearing both the "Product" and the "Dev Lead" hats.  We are a small company, which requires flexibility and nimbleness.  While he seemed to be managing the dual roles just fine on the surface, conversations with him revealed otherwise.  These roles are often at odds (Product wants, Dev has to prioritize where it focuses), and he wasn't able to his all to both sides.  He mentioned that he was starting the process of looking outside the company to fill the Dev Lead role, and I felt a strange mix of emotions...

* Not going to be me!  The fear-monger had already begun battening down the hatches.
* I don't want to ramp up another manager!  Bringing someone in from the outside introduces tons of challenges, ones I've had to overcome in the past.  So many details, systems, and proceses for them to learn...
* Am I finally ready for this myself?  I know I've got the technical chops, and have built trust at the company over several years.  Am I at the point now where I can shed the "that's not for me" fear?

That last bullet point is something that's been growing within me over the past few years.  Now a father with a (gasp) teenager (and more on the way), I've got over a decade of parenting under my belt.  I've also growing and facing fear/emotional baggage with just being a developer.  Not allowing negativity to swamp me when things are low.  Being considerate and helpful to others.  Lots of reading on stoicism, buddhism, and other philosophies.  Basically, working hard at being a better grown up.  Am I ready?
