While my day job involves software, and non-work hours usually involves family, I'm also trying to improve my banjo skills.  The sweet, rolling sound of the banjo - it's like the guitar's weird cousin.  But once you get hooked, it's mesmerizing.  How does so much sound come from these fingers?  And how can I move them faster!?

I'm jotting down a few feelings and thoughts around my banjo playing, and hope to come back to this in a year.  Triumphantly shaking my head at how little I knew then (now).  Banjo deeper soaked into my soul, and resonating through my life.

I'm slowly working through my first Scruggs tune (Foggy Mountain breakdown), and am paying close attention to the fingerings and his instruction.  In the past, I've brushed through it, but done so sloppily.  Could only play with the tabs in front of me.  And couldn't play fast.  Now, I'm paying close attention to the fingerings, and clean playing.  Am trying to memorize it (with my mind and fingers) so that I don't need the book.  And putting it to a metronome.  Guiderails for my tempo, that will gradually push me faster.  

I'm also learning some of the traditional songs, ones with vocal parts.  Playing and singing, memorizing and shedding book.  I've played with others in the past and was lost without my book in front of me - that's not a great feeling.  I want to be able to walk into any place, sans book, and bust out 20 traditional songs.  Be that guy at the campfire.  A wisened bard, telling the tales of my ancestors.

I'm dabbling with the capo.  I've avoided this in the past, just because it seems like a strange, unnecessary burden.  But if you want to play some of the tabs out there, and/or play along with others in different keys, you need to become comfortable with a capo.  Baby steps here, part of me still viscerally rejects it.  But I've opened the door.

Ragtime!  I've always been drawn to the sounds of ragtime, it's a similar flood of notes that the banjo brings.  How is one person making all that music!  So I've purchased a book of Scott Joplin tabs for banjo.  I'm applying the same mentality as I do to Scruggs - learn it carefully, try to memorize, and slowly ramp up speed.

That summarizes my current M.O.  I will continue to apply this methodology, and look for other avenues of growth.  Riding my banjo on out into the horizon of the future!
