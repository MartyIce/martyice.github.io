It's been a pretty wild year for me.  About 8 months ago, I agreed to step up into a management position at work.  I've remained a coder my entire career (25ish years?), and there were a few reasons I have avoided management:

* Fear.  Fear of failure, fear of unknown, fear of conflict.  Fear *can* be a valid reason for avoiding situations (eg, climbing Mt Everest).  However, if it involves situations where actual bodily or mental harm won't occur, it might be healthy to confront it.
* "I just want to code".  I love to code, and am fairly proficient with it.  It's comfortable for me, with plenty of opportunities for "easy accolades".  But is also safe, and lacks risk.  Sometimes risk can lead to reward!
* Impatience with the "soft skills".  Talking to people, caring about their problems, scheduling, etc.  Management involves focusing on helping others, rather than my internal drive to BUILD CODE.  Code is easy - squishy humans are hard.

However, with age and wisdom, I started to second guess this reasoning.  This year brought an opportunity that allowed me to step up into a management role, I took it.  Here's some of what motivated the decision:

* Regret minimization - I often think back to prior opportunities I passed up at the time, and wonder "what if".  What if I'd stepped up, out of my comfort zone, and stuck my neck out?  Would I be in a completely different place and mindset now?
* Exploring discomfort - as I age and mature, I'm finding philosophy and emotional exploration more interesting.  What makes me (and us) tick?  Why do bad things seem bad, and good things seem good?
* This ain't my first rodeo - I'd already had a few managers in my current role who moved on.  Why train another?  Is there something they know that I don't?  I can do this as well as they can!

So here I sit, many months later, wearing big boy pants, feeling pretty good about things.  While I still have a long way to go, the sky hasn't yet fallen, and I've learned alot along the way.

One of my biggest day to day obstacles continues to be fear - what if I mess up?  What if something goes wrong?  What if someone calls bullshit on my thinking?  Tense butterflies in stomach, relentless checking of Slack, general anxiety.  I continue to try to step outside of this cloud, and identify the sources of anxiety.  One rule of thumb I'm trying to be mindful of is "harvesting mistakes".

We should always try to do right, and avoid mistakes.  Mistakes cost us in many ways, and they are embarassing.  Small mistakes annoy us.  Big mistakes punch us in the stomach.  Catastrophic mistakes knock us to the floor.  No one likes mistakes.  But they will *always* happen.  How can we use them to our advantage?

While still spending alot of energy trying to avoid mistakes, I'm working towards overcoming fear of them and their consequences.  When you think about it...

* Mistakes will always happen - As long as I take actions on a regular basis, I will occasionally mess up.  Software development is a complex affair, and myriad situations can arise.  We try to mitigate as much as possible, but infinite variables are evolving all the time.  Sometimes, they bite us.
* Mistakes are teaching opportunities - rather than crumpling into a ball, we can learn from them.  They are real-life chances to confront fear, to keep an even head in a difficult situation, and grow as thinking beings.
* My mental well-being demands it - I have no choice but to change my mindset.  Treating every mistake like some sort of injury is not sustainable.  I can't be a self-induced punching bag for the next few decades.  Its time to flip the script.

So that's where I am.  Almost looking forward to the next mistake!  Sit back and marvel at it.  Poke it.  Learn where it came from, and how to do better next time.  And walk away a wiser individual.  Onward!
