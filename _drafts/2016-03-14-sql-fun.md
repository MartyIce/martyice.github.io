title: Transporting a Table out of SQL Server
tweetText: Transporting a Table out of SQL Server
---

I recently had a development task that boiled down to removing a heavily referenced table from our SQL database.  We had an internal table ("Addresses") that many other tables (15 or so?) referenced with foreign keys.  We needed to deprecate this table, and instead source the addresses from an external 

In order to remove the Addresses table, we had to both remove the "hard" database links (ie, the Foreign Keys), as well as introduce a new "soft" relation (ie, a column in each table tracking the associated address, but not enforced using database constraints).  We already had a non-key unique identifier in the Addresses table ("StaticID"), and will use this value for all other tables to specify their address.

So in a nutshell:

INSERT IMAGE HERE

I hate manually writing boilerplate code, and am a sucker for SQL that generates SQL, so that's what I did here.  No rocket science, but it saves a ton of time overall, avoids repetition-induced errors, and allows for JIT generation of all the necessary SQL at any time in the process.  

The different steps were:

Add New StaticID
----------------

The first SQL statement is responsible for finding all the tables that referenced our Addresses table, and ensuring they had a column to reference the StaticID (w/o using a FK on this new column).

SELECT c.name AS ColName, t.name AS TableName,
'IF NOT EXISTS' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '(SELECT * FROM sys.columns' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'WHERE Name = N''' + REPLACE(c.name, 'RemoteAddressId', 'RemoteAddressStaticID') +  '''' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'AND Object_ID = Object_ID(N''' + t.Name + '''))' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'BEGIN' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'ALTER TABLE ' + t.name +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '	ADD ' + REPLACE(c.name, 'RemoteAddressId', 'RemoteAddressStaticID') + ' NVARCHAR(50)' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'END' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'GO' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10)
FROM sys.columns c
    JOIN sys.tables t ON c.object_id = t.object_id
WHERE c.name LIKE '%RemoteAddressID%'

The output of this SQL looked something like:



Update New StaticID
-------------------

The next SQL statement was responsible for populating this new StaticID column with the correct value from the Addresses table:

SELECT c.name AS ColName, t.name AS TableName,
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'UPDATE ' + t.Name +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'SET ' + REPLACE(c.name, 'RemoteAddressId', 'RemoteAddressStaticID') +  ' = ra.StaticID' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'FROM ' + t.Name + ' t' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'JOIN RemoteAddresses ra on t.' + c.name + ' = ra.ID' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'GO' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10)
FROM sys.columns c
    JOIN sys.tables t ON c.object_id = t.object_id
WHERE c.name LIKE '%RemoteAddressID%'

The output of this SQL looked something like:

Drop ID Referencing Column
--------------------------

Finally, the SQL that will drop the old FK constraint, followed by dropping the actual ID-referencing column.  This SQL required a little more manual finessing after generating, as there were some additional considerations here:

1) Didn't want to drop ID from certain large historical tables, because we didn't want or need to update a ton of legacy data.

2) Certain tables had different nullability in the AddressID column, and we want to preserve this using the new StaticID column.

Here's the SQL:

DECLARE @fks TABLE
(
 FK_Table nvarchar(255),
 FK_Column nvarchar(255),
 PK_Table nvarchar(255),
 PK_Column nvarchar(255),
 Constraint_Name nvarchar(255)
);
INSERT @fks
SELECT
    FK_Table = FK.TABLE_NAME, FK_Column = CU.COLUMN_NAME, PK_Table = PK.TABLE_NAME, PK_Column = PT.COLUMN_NAME, Constraint_Name = C.CONSTRAINT_NAME
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS C
INNER JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS FK
    ON C.CONSTRAINT_NAME = FK.CONSTRAINT_NAME
INNER JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS PK
    ON C.UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT_NAME = PK.CONSTRAINT_NAME
INNER JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE CU
    ON C.CONSTRAINT_NAME = CU.CONSTRAINT_NAME
INNER JOIN (
            SELECT i1.TABLE_NAME, i2.COLUMN_NAME FROM
                INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS i1
            INNER JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE i2
                ON i1.CONSTRAINT_NAME = i2.CONSTRAINT_NAME WHERE i1.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'PRIMARY KEY'
           ) PT
    ON PT.TABLE_NAME = PK.TABLE_NAME WHERE PK.TABLE_NAME = 'RemoteAddresses'

SELECT c.name AS ColName, t.name AS TableName,
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'IF EXISTS(' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'SELECT *' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + 'FROM sys.columns '+ 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '	WHERE Name = N''' + c.Name + '''' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '	AND Object_ID = Object_ID(N''' + t.Name + '''))' + 
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '   BEGIN' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '   ALTER TABLE ' + t.Name + ' DROP CONSTRAINT ' + fks.Constraint_Name +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '   ALTER TABLE ' + t.Name + ' DROP COLUMN ' + c.Name + '' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '   -- (Uncomment if this is 0: ' + CAST(COLUMNPROPERTY(OBJECT_ID(t.Name, 'U'), c.Name, 'AllowsNull')  AS VARCHAR) + ') ALTER TABLE ' + t.Name + ' ALTER COLUMN ' + REPLACE(c.name, 'RemoteAddressId', 'RemoteAddressStaticID') + ' NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL' +
CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) + '   END',
COLUMNPROPERTY(OBJECT_ID(t.Name, 'U'), c.Name, 'AllowsNull')
FROM sys.columns c
    JOIN sys.tables t ON c.object_id = t.object_id
	join @fks fks ON t.name = fks.FK_Table
WHERE c.name LIKE '%RemoteAddressID%'

The output of this SQL looked something like:


Life Saver
----------

At one point working on all the SQL above, I inadvertently closed a SQL window, and hadn't saved the contents beforehand.  Very annoyed, I thought I was going to rewrite, but was wondering whether SQL server kept a history of executed statements (somewhat similar to git's reflog).  And lo and behold, it does in a limited fashion!  The SQL below allowed me to find my big bad SQL statement, and meant I didn't have to hammer the whole thing out again.  Very useful!

SELECT t.[text]
FROM sys.dm_exec_cached_plans AS p
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(p.plan_handle) AS t
WHERE t.[text] LIKE N'%sys.tables%';
