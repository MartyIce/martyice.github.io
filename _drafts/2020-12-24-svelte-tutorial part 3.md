<h3>Svelte Tutorial, Part 3</h3>
This is the 3nd post in a series walking through [Svelte's][svelte tutorial] online tutorial.  In the first post we covered Introduction, [Reactivity][svelte reactivity], and [Props][svelte props].  The second post explored [Logic][svelte logic] and [Events][svelte events].  Today we will explore [Bindings][svelte bindings], which are used to "tie" variable and state values with inputs.

<h4>Text Inputs</h4>
The [Text Input][svelte text input] section begins with a general rule of Svelte - "data flow in Svelte is top down â€” a parent component can set props on a child component, and a component can set attributes on an element, but not the other way around".  This is super important to solidify in your mind.  In my initial dabbling with Svelte, this tripped me up - a child component would update a variable, but I wouldn't see that updated in the "parent scope".  Always remember, "data flows downhill"

Now it's time to break that rule!  Bindings allow you to pass variables to child elements via properties, AND have changes within the child reflected at the parent level.  The Svelte tutorial starts with built in HTML components - up first, is the Text input.

Here's a simple example from the tutorial, where we initially set the value of the input element to our variable:

<p class="codeblock-label">Simple Text Binding</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>

<input value={name}>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

Note that even though the input starts with "world" as it's value, when you type within the input the "Hello {name}" text does not change.  This is because of the "data flows downhill" behavior of Svelte.  

However, if we use the [bind][svelte bind] directive within Svelte, the data now flows both ways (uphill even!).  Here's what that looks like:

<p class="codeblock-label">Two Way Text Binding</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>

<input bind:value={name}>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

This one simple keyword eliminates alot of boilerplate code, and brings the behavior of the app inline with our expectation ("I'm associating this variable with this input!").

<h4>Numeric Inputs</h4>
The section on [Numeric Inputs][svelte numeric inputs] highlights a difficulty with the DOM and numeric binding - the DOM treats everything as a string (ie, properties of individual elements are stored as strings).  Svelte handles this under the covers by coercing variables to numbers as part of the binding.  For example, the following Svelte code:

<p class="codeblock-label">Numeric Binding</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let myVal = 1;
</script>

<input type=number bind:value={myVal} min=0 max=10>
```

Looks like this in the compiled Javascript:

<p class="codeblock-label">Compiled Numeric Binding</p>
```javascript
	p(ctx, [dirty]) {
		if (dirty & /*myVal*/ 1 && to_number(input.value) !== /*myVal*/ ctx[0]) {
			set_input_value(input, /*myVal*/ ctx[0]);
		}
	},
```

Less boilerplate, leaner code!

<h4>Checkbox Inputs</h4>
[Checkboxes][svelte checkboxes] behave like you would expect, but instead of binding to the "value" property, bind to "checked":

<p class="codeblock-label">Checkbox Binding</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let isChecked = false;
</script>

<label>
	<input type=checkbox bind:checked={isChecked}>
	Please send me spam.
</label>
```

<h4>Group Inputs</h4>
[Group Inputs][svelte group inputs] include Radio Buttons and Checkboxes (when the checkboxes are bound to an array).  These offer straightforward methods of collecting a single value from a list (Radio), or one-to-many selections from a list (Checkbox).  The tutorial also demonstrates using the [each][svelte each] block to programatically build a list of Group Inputs from an array.  Here's a quick example:

<p class="codeblock-label">Group Input Binding</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let favoriteInstruments = [];

	let instruments = [
		'Guitar',
		'Drum', 
		'Bass',
		'Vocals'
	];
</script>

<h2>What Can You Play?</h2>

{#each instruments as instrument}
	<label>
		<input type=checkbox bind:group={favoriteInstruments} value={instrument}>
		{instrument}
	</label>
{/each}	
```

One thing to note from this example - the collection bound to the "available" list (instruments) is different than that bound to the "selected" list (favoriteInstruments).  I initially stumbled in my example, and used the same collection throughout.  The result was every item was initially selected, and de-selecting them removed them from the screen.  Seeing something broken, then making it work correctly, is a great way to learn!

<h4>Textarea Inputs</h4>
[Textarea inputs][svelte textarea inputs] work the same as other inputs, bind a variable the "value" property on the "textarea" element.  The tutorial does drop a bomb of shorthand in this section - as long as the variable is named the same as the property, you can shorten the binding in the following:

<p class="codeblock-label">Textarea Input 'Longform' Binding</p>
```javascript
<textarea bind:value={value}></textarea>
```

to an abbreviated:

<p class="codeblock-label">Textarea Input 'Abbreviated' Binding</p>
```javascript
<textarea bind:value></textarea>
```

This applies for all bindings - anywhere you're using "bind:property=property", it can be replaced "bind:property".  Little shortcuts here and there add up over time, and make things more readable.

<h4>Select Bindings</h4>
The section on [select bindings][svelte select bindings] doesn't bring any surprises - if you've been following along, the example they provide in their documentation uses the Sveltey things we've been learning so far.  But it's a rich example, you should definitely check it out and grok it all.

<h4>Select Multiple</h4>
[Select multiple][svelte select multiple] is a variant of the standard "select" input, allowing the selection of multiple items.  Just toss the "multiple" keywords into your "select" node.  Easy peasey!

<h4>Contenteditable Bindings</h4>
The [contenteditable][svelte content editable] section introduces a strange twist - you can use this to allow editing of "textContent" or "innerHTML" properties within elements that [support editable content][contenteditable].  I didn't know this functionality existed in HTML!  I was curious why you might need this property, and did some googling.  Some think its [evil][contenteditable evil], whereas this page declares it's good for [WYSIWYG][contenteditable wysiwyg].  

Basically, if find yourself needing to support some advanced user input, you might consider this functionality?

<h4>Each Block Bindings</h4>
[Each Block Bindings][svelte each block bindings] build on the [each blocks][svelte each block] we covered earlier.  Essentially, if you build a collection of elements from an array, using the "each block", then you can bind to properties on items in the array.  The tutorial warns about [immutability][immutability] - binding to children of an array in an each block will mutate the array.  If you want to keep things immutable, then you'll want to avoid input bindings, and use event handlers to react to input value changes.

<h4>Media Elements</h4>
Svelte supports [media][svelte media] elements, allowing you to embed audio and video in your components.  This is an example of:

a) How long it's been since I've done a deep dive into HTML/Javascript - I wasn't aware these HTML elements existed!
b) How little I know about other frameworks - I'm not sure whether Svelte is providing [table stakes][table stakes] here, and all frameworks have these, or if this is something unique to svelte.  

Briefly googling, it looks like [react][react video] and [vue][vue major] both rely on external libraries, so it could be that Svelte is unique in this regard...

<h4>Dimensions</h4>
Svelte provides the ability to [bind to DOM element dimensions][svelte dimensions] in a "read only" fashion.  In other words, you can bind a variable, and if the element is resized, your variable will be updated...but not vice versa.  To my dumb Javascript sensibilities, sizing and layout is one of the biggest challenges I face when creating pages.  I'm wondering whether these dimensions would be useful in manually updating other components if a bound component is forced to resize?  I plan on diving deeply into CSS at some point - that might be a good time to revisit this section.

<h4>This</h4>
Svelte allows you to [bind variables directly to DOM elements][svelte bind this], providing a quick way of accessing the low-level functionality of a DOM element.  Note this depends on the component mounting within the overall Svelte hierarchy, and the variable won't be initialized until the [OnMount Lifecycle function][svelte lifecycle function].  We will cover these in an upcoming post.

<h4>Component Bindings</h4>
Extending the "data flows downhill" concept we explored in standard input bindings above, you can also [bind custom properties on child components][svelte component binding].  This allows changes to a custom child component to propagate back to the parent.  The tutorial offers a warning about doing so, however - if you rely on component binding, it can be difficult to track the flow of data around your application.  For complex data binding scenarios, it is recommend to explore using something like [stores][svelte stores] to manage your application state.  This will also be covered in a future post.

<h3>Summary</h3>
And that's it for Bindings!  With these in your toolbelt, you can begin to add serious functionality to a web UI.  This is where I delved into my first experiment, a Svelte UI for rendering Azure Application Insights graphs.  The [Azure Portal][azure portal] provides a powerful mechanism for interacting with Azure resources, but one disappointment has been that their Application Insights graphs don't render in the mobile web view.  I used this as an opportunity to combine Svelte, [ChartJS][chartjs], and [Application Insights REST API][application insights restapi] to provide a simple chart for App Insights in the mobile web.
