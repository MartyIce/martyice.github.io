title: Jekyll Inside

Ahh, to have a blog published.  Such satisfaction.  Look at me, a published author!  It wasn't always this way, however.  Once I had made the decision to blog, and had a few ideas to write about, I didn't know where to put it all.  Or how to put it there.  Vague recollections of "Blogspot" and "Blogspot" filled my brain, but I assumed that things had progressed since my last foray.  Where do we go from here?

I reached out to my manager <a href="https://stevenmaguire.com/">Steven</a> to get his thoughts, and he recommended <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.  Jekyll is a "simple" framework that can be used to generate static content quickly, without needing much infrastructure (eg database, web services, etc).  Utilizing Jekyll would appear to get me up and running quickly, and give me something new to learn, so I jumped in.  So far, it's exactly what I need!  I realize this site still looks like a Soviet-era military manual, but my immature design/styling skills are to blame for that (I'm working on it!  More to come!).

I won't dive into the weeds on implementation details, my basic infrastructure consists of:

1. Site written with a simple Jekyll starter project (forked from Github)

2. Hosting provided (for free) by Github, via my Github "personal site".

Here's the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">post</a> I leaned on heavily to get this up and running, and it went pretty much without a hitch*.

Here are my impressions thus far:

1. Jekyll is alot of fun, with awesome documentation.  Compared to the bomb shelter you're viewing here, their site is very inviting.  Easy to get up and running locally, and makes creating a blog a brainless exercise.  It doesn't offer much "local power" (ie, database stuff), but in this day and age, there is so much free/cheap power available using external services, I don't miss that at all.  I've got my social hooks, analytics, a robust commenting system, etc.

2. Jekyll uses <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which I'm only beginning to learn about.  It's pretty simple on the surface, but I'm thinking/hoping it goes much deeper, and I'll continue to pickup tricks here over time.  I mentally lump this into the "higher level language that abstracts things away" category, similar to Coffeescript.  I feel a little sheepish for not knowing many of these languages, and am glad I'm getting the opportunity to learn Markdown here.

3. Github hosting rocks.  I get my blog versioned controlled, and pushing changes to remote automatically updates my blog.  No brainer.
