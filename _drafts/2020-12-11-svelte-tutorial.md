<h3>Svelte</h3>
[Svelte][svelte] is a [reactive][reactive] Javascript framework that hit the scene a few years ago.  Svelte differs from other reactive frameworks in that it builds the reactivity in the build/compile stage, rather than relying on a Virtual DOM running in the browser.  This means a smaller initial download, and typically a faster runtime experience.  This post will walk through their awesome [tutorial][svelte tutorial].  I provide some of my own examples, but often just copy some of the code directly from the Svelte tutorial.

Note - I'm happy that you're here reading, and hope to provide some sort of value describing my experience.  But their tutorial is really fantastic, if what's here appeals to you, please check it out directly.

And before you go thinking that this post is a simple re-hash of the Svelte tutorial...take note!  There is an imaginary, unsanctioned Svelte ninja master monitoring your progress!  If he is pleased with your attention and focus, you will be rewarded!

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
The Svelte tutorial follows a format I've seen in the past, with instructions on the left and a javascript sandbox on the right.  I'm occasionally blown away at how far this "sandbox" concept has come along.  There is something very "meta" about using a javascript framework to teach that same framework.  One cool feature I didn't notice at first - the "JS Output" and "CSS Output" tabs in the lower right.  With these, you can see the actual javascript generated by the Svelte compiler.  Very useful for gaining a deeper understanding of how the compiler turns the Svelte syntax into raw javascript/CSS.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This section walks through some of the fundamental building blogs of Svelte, including bindings, styling, and nesting.

<h4>Binding</h4>
Out of the gate, the tutorial introduces the concept of [simple binding][tutorial simple binding].  Using something like the following code, you can easily bind variables to HTML:

<p class="codeblock-label">Simple Binding Example</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

Pretty self explanatory.  Looking at the underlying JS output, it gets a little hairy, but thankfully I don't need to understand the raw JS (yet).  That's a distant mountain peak I may strive to climb someday.

<h4>A11y</h4>
A discovery made in this [section][tutorial dynamic attributes] - Svelte's compiler will warn you if you're missing [A11y][a11y] (accessibility) tags.  What a thoughtful inclusion to the framework!  A11y is often overlooked or not prioritized, but the people who depend on it gain so much from it.  Kudos to the Svelte team for prioritizing this feature!

<p><img src="/images/svelte/a11y.png" alt="Accessibility is important to Svelte" title="Accessibility is important to Svelte" /></p>

<h4>Styling</h4>
[Styling][tutorial styling] in Svelte is straightforward.  In its simplest form, just drop a style block within your component.  These component-level style blocks are scoped to that component, and they won't overwrite styles elsewhere.  Nice encapsulation.  It feels like an area that could cause slight confusion at times ("why doesn't this font look like the rest?").  So if you are wrestling with strange styling behavior, look for scoped, isolated styling tags.

<h4>Nested Components</h4>
[Nested Components][tutorial nested components] allow you to build a hierarchy of components.  This helps to keep your components small, with [singular responsibility][srp].  This division of labor promotes re-use and avoids code sprawl.  The following example is simple, but you can imagine a bigger app where a much larger hierarchy of components would be built. 

<p class="codeblock-label">Child.svelte</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let coolVariable = 'cool'
</script>
```

<p class="codeblock-label">Parent.svelte</p>
```javascript
<script>
	let parentResponsibilities = 10000;
</script>
<Child />
```

<h4>Making an App</h4>
The introduction [wraps up][tutorial making app] with an overview of how to turn these simple concepts into an actual app.  It provides suggestions for build tools and code editors.  At this point in the tutorial, you probably have enough under your belt to begin playing around with things.  But there's alot more power to uncover...

<h3>Reactivity</h3>
Now that the rudimentary basics are covered, the tutorial dives into reactivity.  This is where the framework really shines, and it quickly becomes apparent why "reactivity" is so prevalent in modern Javascript frameworks.  Once you go reactive, you won't go back (tive?)

<h4>Assignments</h4>
The [assignments][tutorial assignments] section provides a simple example of binding an event handler to a button.  It also describes how when you assign a variable within Svelte, it *instruments* the assignment.  It provides a small step towards understanding how the Svelte compiler turns Svelte syntax into vanilla javascript.

This is a key feature of the Svelte framework, and one that makes it so easy to use.  I can write code like this:

<p class="codeblock-label">Svelte Assignment</p>
```javascript
	count += 1;
```

And under the covers, the Svelte compiler produces this:

<p class="codeblock-label">Compiled Javascript</p>
```javascript
    $$invalidate(0, count += 1);
```

Ugly framework boilerplate is hidden from view, but it allows my app to be fluidly reactive.  It feels like the best of both worlds - simple javascript, powerful runtime.

<h4>Reactive Declarations</h4>
There are often assignments in javascript that aren't quite so simple - for example, if you have a value *based* on another value, like the following (copied liberally from the Svelte tutorial):

<p class="codeblock-label">Non-Reactive Variable</p>
```javascript
let count = 0;
doubled = count * 2;
```

While Svelte can "automatically instrument" the first line, the second line is more challenging.  Svelte overcomes this with a custom syntax, hijacking the Javascript "labeled statement":

<p class="codeblock-label">Reactive Variable</p>
```javascript
let count = 0;
$: doubled = count * 2;
```

How badass is that?  Still using standard Javascript (by utilizing a little-used operator), but it takes new meaning and power within Svelte.  Looking at the generated javascript, we can see some intense boilerplate code that we'll never need to worry about:

<p class="codeblock-label">Intense Compiled Javascript</p>
```javascript
	$$self.$$.update = () => {
		if ($$self.$$.dirty & /*count*/ 1) {
			$: $$invalidate(1, doubled = count * 2);
		}
	};
```

<h4>Reactive Statements</h4>
[Reactive Statements][tutorial reactive statements] take this concept even further, allowing us to designate entire blocks of code as "reactive".  Here's an example from the tutorial:

<p class="codeblock-label">Reactive Statement</p>
```javascript
$: if (count >= 10) {
	alert(`count is dangerously high!`);
	count = 9;
}
```

Anytime the value for "count" changes, this code will trigger.  This is super cool - in addition to having the screen update in response to a value change, we can now trigger blocks of code based on values changing.

<h4>Updating Arrays and Objects</h4>
With more complicated scenarios involving [objects and arrays][tutorial arrays objects], there are additional considerations for ensuring reactivity.  It's nothing *horribly* complicated, but it doesn't work *quite* as easily as simple values.  

With arrays, you can't simply modify the contents of the array (push, splice, etc).  This alone won't give the Svelte compiler enough context to recognize a reactive update.  One simple (but inelegant) fix is to assign the variable to itself after modifying:

<p class="codeblock-label">Inelegant Array Updating</p>
```javascript
function addNumber() {
	numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
	numbers = numbers;
}
```

However, there is a more [idiomatic][idiomatic] solution that uses the [spread syntax][spread syntax] to update an array.  Here's an example of where a "pop" can be replaced with spread syntax (special thanks to [this post][immutable array operations] for all the immutable array manipulation examples):

<p class="codeblock-label">Pop Replacement</p>
```javascript
function removeNumber() {
	numbers = [...numbers.slice(0, numbers.length - 1)];
}
```

This pattern gives us immutable arrays, which are valuable for performance and debuggability.  [Immuutability][immutability] is a topic that comes up pretty often when talking about reactive frameworks - probably worth a future post or two entirely devoted to this topic!

The Svelte tutorial provides a rule of thumb for determing whether an assignment will trigger reactivity:  "The name of the updated variable must appear on the left hand side of the assignment."

This feels like an area to pay close attention to while you're learning the framework.  If you see updates that aren't propagated onto the screen, this would be one of the first areas to explore.

<h3>Props</h3>
While encapsulation of state and functionality within components is desirable, it's hard to build anything meaningful without components interacting with each other.  Properties, or "Props", are how Svelte components share data from parent to child.  This "parent to child" qualification is important - if you need a value change in a child to propagate back up to parent, you need to use a more advanced concept, such as [event bindings][tutorial svelte event] or [stores][tutorial svelte store].  We will cover those in a future post.

<h4>Declaring Props</h4>
Props are declared in Svelte by prepending variables with the "export" keyword, eg:

<p class="codeblock-label">Child.svelte</p>
```javascript
<script>
	export let counter;
</script>
```

<p class="codeblock-label">Parent.svelte</p>
```javascript
<Child counter={4} />
```

This is an unusal use of the [export][export] statement.  Similar to "$", Svelte makes use of an existing keyword to accomplish its goals with native javascript.

<h4>Default Values</h4>
Props can be assigned default value in its declaration:

<p class="codeblock-label">Child.svelte</p>
```javascript 
<script>
	export let counter = 10;
</script>
```

Which means if "Parent" doesn't pass the value, it will default.

<p class="codeblock-label">Parent.svelte</p>
```javascript 
<Child /> // "counter" is now defaulted to 10.
```

<h5>Spread Props</h5>
If your code uses an object to maintain state, you can pass this object to a nested component using "spread":

<p class="codeblock-label">Spread Syntax</p>
```javascript 
<Child {...stateObject} />
```

This eliminates the need to pass multiple values to a child component with individual property assignments.

<h3>Summary</h3>
That's enough for today.  We've covered some of the basics, touched on reactivity, and walked through using properties.  Still a ways to go, but it's a fun journey to undertake.  If you like what you see, Svelte's [tutorial][svelte tutorial] will give you a chance to play around with it.  

The imaginary Svelte ninja master on your shoulder is pleased with your progress thus far!  He thinks you should play in the Svelte sandbox for a bit.  The slightest suggestion from this ninja master should be interpreted as law, so you should probably get crackin'.

In the next post, we will dig further into the tutorial, including logic and events.  Onward and upward!
