title: Hello (Again) World!

Time to start YAB (Yet Another Blog)!  I've made several half-assed efforts over the years to start a blog, and each one tends to fizzle out very quickly after inception.  I think there are a few reasons for this:

1. "No time" to work on it.  There IS time, but I spend it on other things.
2. I can't come up with anything interesting to write about.
3. I try to be funny, am not happy with the quality of the humor, and get discouraged.
4. Nobody reads what I write.

I'm hoping this time will be different, for a couple of reasons:

* I've recently started working at a <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com" target="_blank">new company</a>, and am learning a ton of exciting new things.  The next couple of years have the potential for many more educational opportunites.  It's like turning the soil over in the brain - everything's mixing up, getting exposed to air and light for the first time in a long time, and growing wildly in many directions.  Very exciting time for me career-wise!
* As part of my annual goals at the new gig, I've stated that I will start a blog, with at least 6 technical posts, in the next 9-ish months.  While not written in blood, I am a people pleaser, and HAVE to make this happen.  I'd honestly like to have 6 posts in the next 6 weeks - a post a week is doable, right?

So this is me taking it away.  Here's my current plan (another list - I feel like I lean on these too heavily?):

1. I want this blog to be informative.  My hope is that I cover topics well enough, with little nuggets of information, that people actually find answers to questions.  Tutorials, walkthroughs, etc.
2. I want this blog to motivate me to learn new things, and ponder those things deeply.  So many technologies out there I'd like to learn, and this could be a perfect nudge to learn them.
3. This will mainly start as a technical blog, but I'd love to be able to write about things beyond tech.  Not going to overthink this one, but I'm hoping once the "stage-fright/writers-block" glacier starts to melt from writing about tech, that other things will come pouring out as well.

I've read many times that the most important thing about writing is to do it regularly, so that's one of my priorities - releasing posts at a regular clip.  Allocating a certain amount of time per day and week to ensure I'm productive and prolific.  I need to balance that with quality - if I'm not informing and learning (and hopefully entertaining), then I'm just filling space with words.

There are many other questions I have in my mind right now (am I using the "I" pronoun too much here?  Which voice should I use!?  Am I using enough colorful adjectives?!?!).  I hope to find clues and answers to these concerns along the way...if I try to solve it all initially, before publishing any posts, this blog will die before getting started.  Apologies in advance for awkward phrasing, boring writing, and obvious attempts at meager humor.

I also want to note that I'm planning on sprinkling my doubts, questions, and side thoguhts into my writing.  I feel like that will give a better picture of my train of thought, and hopefully provide a little comic relief.  If it gets too unwieldy or distracting, then I'll cut it out. I am a work in progress, and so is my writing.
