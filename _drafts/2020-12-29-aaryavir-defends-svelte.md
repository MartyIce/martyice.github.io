tweetText: The hero of our tale must defend Svelte against a phalanx of doubters.

This story is a continuation of [Aaryavir Mentions Svelte]({% post_url 2020-12-05-aaryavir-mentions-svelte %}), a gripping saga of one developer's brave stance against the status quo.  Read on to learn of the battles he fought, defending the choice of using  Svelte for a new application...

<h3>The Pin Drop</h3>

The silence lasted only but a few moments, but to Aaryavir, it lasted much longer.  He was confident in his skills as a developer, but was far from the top of this org chart.  There were heavy hitters in this room.  People who had been around for several rewrites, builders of today's code base.  The respected smart opinions...but demanded evidence.  This suggestion of Svelte caused ripples, and confusion.  

Thomas spoke first.  "What the hell is Svelte?"

Thomas was the cynic of the group, approaching anything new with skepticism.  But at the same time, he was sensible, and on several occasions had helped Aaryavir with a tricky coding problem.  Aaryavir trusted Thomas, and was glad he's the one who broke the ice.  Looking only in his direction (and avoiding all other eyes in the room), Aarayavir responded.

"Svelte is a new javascript framework I've been hearing alot about lately.  It's reactive like [React][react] and [Vue][vue], but doesn't work the same way.  From what I understand, it compiles your code down to raw javascript in the build step, and avoids some of the problems in those other frameworks.  Things like performance and download size.  Their website is slick - there's a [video][svelte rethinking] on there explaining their rationale around compilation.  I usually don't have the patience to sit through videos like that, but this one was pretty entertaining.  Dude knows what he's talking about"

Thomas nodded thoughtfully, and Aaryavir felt a glimmer of hope.  Someone was listening!  

Then Aldara asked, "how sure are you about this framework?  We've got a large base of devices in the field with limited processor power, and sometimes not great bandwidth.  This 'Svenne' sounds too experimental, and I'm worried it would break on some older devices?"

Aaryavir smiled and patiently explained, "it's 'Svelte' actually, and the name actually fits it pretty well!  'Svelte' means 'slender and elegant', and the Svelte download size is typically much smaller than those other frameworks.  It's reliance on compilation really slims it down.  Also, the end product is 'clean' Javascript, which I think has a *better* chance of running well on those older devices.  I think this framework is perfect for this use case!"

Lyssa pounded her fist on the table and interrupted, "This sounds like a waste of time!  I don't care about slick websites, funny videos, or some obscure, old-device use case!  We are facing a crisis, and need a battle-hardened framework to solve it!  We need to stop wasting time with half-baked ideas, and focus on PROVEN technology!"

Aaryavir took a deep breath and collected himself.  Lyssa could be harsh, typically shooting first and asking questions later.  But she was one of the strongest engineers on the team.  Her take-no-shit attitude was from years of facing down impossible situations, and finding ways around them.  She'd be hard to convince, but if Aaryavir could get her to consider Svelte, she'd be a big help in convincing the others.

"That's what I thought at first as well - yet another framework, in a landscape full of them!  But their [website][svelte] has a section showing who's using it, and it's a huge list.  These are big, proven companies, and they're not going to mess around with toys.  [Go Daddy][godaddy], [Phillips][phillips], [NY Times][nytimes], and like 100 others.  The list goes on and on.  That same page shows their list of volunteers, and it's huge as well - several hundred people.  There is serious support for this framework.  And they're on V3 of the framework - it is not some new, half-baked idea!".

Lyssa was already checking out the Svelte website on her laptop, which gave Aaryavir hope.  Her expression seemed to be growing thougtful.  In fact, several people were now checking out the Svelte site, which made him more hopeful yet.  Who would be next?

"Svelte sounds cool", admitted Theodoar.  "But we're going to want to move in a hurry, and apparently you're the only one with Svelte experience.  If we choose it, there'd be a long ramp-up period.  I don't want to get stuck with months of learning while the old shitty marketing site continues to fall down."

"That's one of the best things about it!" Aaryavir exclaimed.  "It is super easy to get up and running with it!  Their tutorial is one of the best I've ever seen.  Real-time experimenting with the concepts as they are introduced, and a powerful sandbox environment.  It demonstrates the end result, as well as 'under the covers' javascript.  You really have to see this thing, it's like candy!".  The room chuckled at Aaryavir's unintentional reference.  There was a palpable shift in the mood, and Aaryavir took a moment to exhale.  Had he won the room over?

Looking around, Aaryavir saw optimistic looks on most faces.  Some were still looking at the Svelte site, and many were nodding.  Before long, everyone's attention had drifted down the table to the figure seated at the head.  There sat Fallon, the sage of the group.  Her opinion would either make or break the idea.  She was deep in thought, looking up at the ceiling.  Asking herself questions, and formulating answers.  Her deliberation continued for a few moments, and Aaryavir almost felt an out of body experience.  Fear, stress, hope, all churning in his stomach.  This type of anticipation and pressure may be normal to some, but not him.  All he could do is wait, and breathe.

Finally, Fallon looked up, and focused her gaze on Aaryavir.  "I like it.  Let's get started."
