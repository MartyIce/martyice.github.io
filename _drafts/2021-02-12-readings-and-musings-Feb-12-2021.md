<h3>I Almost Got Fired for Choosing React in Our Enterprise App</h3>
[link][react fired]

It's strangely engaging to read about other people's problems.  And when they occur with software projects, it can be educational as well!  This author had some problems with a migration from [WPF] (Microsoft's Windows Presentation Framework) to a web-based solution (which they opted to implement in [React]).

Many of the issues described here aren't specific to React (evolving framework, lack of standards, lack of training).  But it did resonate with me personally, as the evolving React framework has confused me on my learning path.  Components -> Functions, Hooks, Redux vs State, etc.  Big software projects are complicated, and sometimes without a firm hand on the wheel, can veer way off course.

I found myself reading deeply into the comments on this one as well.  Many different perspectives on why things went wrong, sharing of similar experiences, and suggestions for what might have worked better.  Hopefully from painful experiences like this, lessons can be learned, and people do better next time.
