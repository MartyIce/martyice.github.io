<h3>I Almost Got Fired for Choosing React in Our Enterprise App</h3>
[link][react fired]

It's strangely engaging to read about other people's problems.  And when they occur with software projects, it can be educational as well!  This author had some problems with a migration from [WPF] (Microsoft's Windows Presentation Framework) to a web-based solution (which they opted to implement in [React]).

Many of the issues described here aren't specific to React (evolving framework, lack of standards, lack of training).  But it did resonate with me personally, as the evolving React framework has confused me on my learning path.  Components -> Functions, Hooks, Redux vs State, etc.  Big software projects are complicated, and sometimes without a firm hand on the wheel, can veer way off course.

I found myself reading deeply into the comments on this one as well.  Many different perspectives on why things went wrong, sharing of similar experiences, and suggestions for what might have worked better.  Hopefully from painful experiences like this, lessons can be learned, and people do better next time.

<h3>New ‘Elite Dangerous’ players are getting tricked into a forced labor camp</h3>
[link][elite dangerous labor]

This is a crazy one.  As video games become bigger and more realistic, "real world effects" begin seeping in.  We've seen this manifest in several ways, including virtual currency becoming valuable, real artists hosting performances on Fortnite, etc.  

This story highlights a recent development in [Elite Dangerous], an [MMO][mmo] (Massively Multiplayer Online game) that allows you to explore and develop the Milky Way.  Apparently a group of space-faring baddies have concocted a scheme where they dupe [noobs] into providing "slave labor" mining for them.  Just like the hucksters of old, who would lurk around train stations and ports, waiting to prey on immigrants, these modern day swindlers troll places in the game where new players may hang out.  They lure these players off to a distant mining colony with promises of wealth.  However, once the unsuspecting victims arrive, they realize they have no way back, and are forced to mine the rare Void Opals for their captors, and sell them back at a fraction of a cost.  With no means of escaping, their video game existence becomes that of servitude, busting their digital backs towards the profit of others.

In another example of complexity spontaneously arising from this games, groups of do-gooders are now rallying together to rescue these unfortunate citizens.  They are grouping together and sending cargo ships to the forsaken planet to give those stranded there a lift home.  Known as the "Fuel Rats", these heroes typically save players that have run out of fuel.  Recognizing the crime that is happening, they have banded together to do the same for these captured miners.  It is a worthy tale of criminals, victims, and heroes!

It should be worth noting that these trapped players *could* escape their predicament by simply terminating their account and beginning anew.  Some have done so, whereas others are continuing to participate, perhaps to play a small part in video game history.

I must admit, while I loved this story and was amazed at how this situation came out of nowhere, I am a bit disappointed as well.  It seems that if humans can take advantage of other humans, they will.  Whether that means enslaving labor to build the pyramids, or to virtual mine fake treasure.  I realize this particular example is "pretend", but it still makes me a little sad to hear about.
