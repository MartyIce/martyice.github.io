<h3>22 Things You Should Give Up if You Want to Be a Successful Developer</h3>
[link][22 things]

The web is full of self-improvement lists (either articles or tweetstorms), and they all seem to blend together.  I still enjoy reading the good ones, though.  They offer re-inforcement of good ideas, and sometimes an old idea has a new application to an event/situation I've recently gone through.   This post has a few "developer-centric" ideas, but most of the items could be applied to anything in life you'd like to pursue.  Be a good person, live healthily, stop wasting time.  One that stood out to me was "Give Up Not Believing In Yourself", largely due to the Winston Churchill quote:

> “When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had never happened.”
— Winston Churchill

Personally, too much of my mental energy is spent worrying about things.  It was enlightening to learn that Mr. Churchill felt the same (although he had some actual serious things to worry about!).  I hope I can remember that the next time I worry about something that will most likely never happen.
