<h3>The Crime of the Century</h3>
The humble [Computer mouse][computer mouse] was a revolutionary advance in the human/computer interface.  Sitting alongside the keyboard, the mouse allows "pointing" at things on screen.  And "clicking" when you'd like an action taken.  With it, windows slid around, context menus opened. 

The mouse is typically critical to people's "computer workflow".  However, it comes with a cost - time.  The interruptions required to switch between "systems" (keyboard typing vs mouse manipulation) are mentally expensive.  What should be nearly instantaneous ("I want to save document now") takes several seconds (5? 10? More?!).  

When writing code, these "interruptions" to standard typing flow happen frequently (navigation, finding usage, finding implementations, breakpoints, etc).  While you may get *really* good with the mouse, the keyboard is orders of magnitude faster (I assume, no actual measurements taken!)

<h3>An Innocent Beginning</h3>
When learning a system, mice make things easier...at first.  You are new to the software, and don't have time to learn keyboard shortcuts (yet!).  With well designed-software, you can often learn just by clicking around.  Opening menus.  But once you know the software, keyboard shortcuts can eliminate the cost of interruptions the mouse incurs.

Why don't all people use them all the time?  Each "mouse interruptions" only takes a few seconds, while learning keyboard shortcuts could take minutes.  Hours even.  It doesn't seem "worth it" to take the time.  But if were to sum a day's worth of "mouse interruptions", they would (probably) far surpass the cost of learning keyboard shortcuts.  When you start doing that day after day (for year after year), the interruption cost skyrockets.

It's like a subscription to that site you signed up for years ago, forgotten, costing $2.99 a month for eternity.  All the while, your time slips away.  "Where do the years go?", you type.  Then you reach for the mouse, slide the pointer up the screen, and click the "send" button.  

<h3>The Forgotten Path</h3>
Ah, the keyboard.  Descendend from the noble typewriter, and perfectly matched to your hands.  You are already using it for the majority of your work.  You might even be a fast typer.  But if you rely on the mouse, the chain of mouse interruptions hangs around your neck.

The mouse involves moving your big arm around, and clicking with a single finger.  Keyboard provides infinite combinations, triggered by any of your fingers.  Keyboard shortcuts make you more productive.  You literally "barely have to lift a finger".

<h3>Tortoise vs the Hare</h3>
It may be helpful to provide an example scenario, and illustrate why the keyboard is a far superior for your computer input needs.  

Let's say you're typing a document (thanks, keyboard), and you need to save your work.  Who hasn't lost work because they took too long between saves (at least, in the days before cloud-based tools).  The experienced document writer knows to save early and often!  Here's what that looks like in two worlds.

Mouse User:  (think the scene from "[Zootopia][zootopia]" in the DMV with Flash the Sloth).  After an extended series of typing on the keyboard to record complicated thoughts (what psycho would use mouse clicks for *that* ?), your internal clock realizes you haven't saved for a bit.  Your brain pauses it's "type on keyboard" neural pattern, and activates the "move mouse" program.  Slowly your large arm is lifted, moves your hand to the mouse, then lowers it to the mouse surface.  Your skin and hand register that contact has been made, and dutifully report as much to the brain.  Delighted, your brain heightens attention on the visual cortex subsystem, and moves to eyes to the location on the screen where "Save" can be accessed.  Once acquired, the arm/hand system begin sliding in a particular direction, and the mouse pointer begins it's slow climb up the screen.  You tongue begins to slide between your lips, an old habit of concentration you picked up from Michael Jordan.  If all goes well, an upcoming series of algorithm executions will result in the computer "Save" functionality to trigger.  I'm skipping the remaining steps because there are alot of them, and you get the picture.  Exciting, exciting times!

Keyboard User:  Ctrl-S.  You don't even need to interrupt your mind flow.  Just interjecting a quick command for the computer to take action.  Streamlined, immediate, orders of magnitude faster.

<h3>Memory vs Disk</h3>
Speaking of orders of magnitude...TODO - disk access times vs memory
