I"ð<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>You hold an architectural idea in your head, but are struggling to communicate it.  Team members think differently about what things are called, where they live, and how they tie together.  Someone erased the whiteboard (and what was there was impossible to read a few days later anyway).  Youâ€™ve seen diagramming used in other places, but you donâ€™t want to install some crappy tool with an impossible user interface (and what do all those symbols mean anyway?!).</p>
