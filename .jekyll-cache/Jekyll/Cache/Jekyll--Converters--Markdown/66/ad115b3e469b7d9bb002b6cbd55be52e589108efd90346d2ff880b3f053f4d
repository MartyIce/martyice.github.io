I"¤<p>Ahh, to have a blog published.  Such satisfaction.  Look at me, a published author!  It wasnâ€™t always this way, however.  Once I decided to blog, and had stockpiled a few ideas to write about, I didnâ€™t know where to put it all.  Or how to put it there.  Vague recollections of â€œBloggerâ€ and â€œBlogspotâ€ crossed my mind, but I hoped things had progressed since my last foray.  Where do we go from here?</p>
