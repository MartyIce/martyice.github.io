I"¬<p>Last post I laid out some reasons for using <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway">AWS API Gateway</a> for creating REST services.  In this post, Iâ€™d like to walk some of the pieces involved, both within AWS, as well as some external tools that can take it to the next level.  In order to cover all the things, Iâ€™m going to paint a high level picture, with links to pages providing more detail.</p>
