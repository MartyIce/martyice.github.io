I"@<h3>Welcome to 100 Days of Javascript!</h3>
<p>I’ve danced and dabbled with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript">Javascript</a> for years.  Plain old javascript, <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, along with an assortment of other frameworks.  But I still consider myself a Javascript newbie.  I know enough to be dangerous, but don’t trust myself with the “bigger decisions”.  Today I’ve decided to take the necessary steps to change this.</p>
