Curious software developer, like to play music, listen to tons too.  Wife and I have 4 little ones, most of my time goes there.

recent Software:
--- 
* Learning a large existing .Net architecture
* Learning Rails on some existing sites.
* Dipping my toe in some clouds (AWS and Azure)
* Learning <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (yay!  You're here!)
* Truly Pair Programming for the first time in my life
* Integrated some email with <a href="https://www.mandrill.com/">Mandrill</a>

recent Music:
--- 
* <a href="http://fieryfurnacesforum.com/site/">Fiery Furnaces</a> - Spotify just recommended them today, they blew my mind, and I had no idea they existed - apparently been around since 2000.  Listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow_City">Widow City</a>, which I almost skipped over because the cover looked so generic.  Looking forward to working my way through this catalog.

* <a href="http://www.flygoldeneagle.net/">Fly Golden Eagle</a> - there are songs where singer reminds me of Andrew Wood, but other songs the sound is their own.  Newest album is a double album, and I'm loving it.

* <a href="http://sturgillsimpson.com/ASGTE/?ref=https://www.google.com/">Sturgill Simpson</a> - Sturgill is the man, and his new album is about to come out.  Cannot wait.

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> is musically incredible, the lyrics entertain, educate, and challenge me.  Like a modern day Funkadelic album.

recent Books:
--- 
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain Driven Design</a> - driving software development using a unified model, built around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering)">domain</a>

* <a href="http://www.ananda.org/free-inspiration/books/autobiography-of-a-yogi">Autobiography of a Yogi</a> - tried this out because of the <a href="http://www.inc.com/hitendra-wadhwa/steve-jobs-self-realization-yogananda.html">Steve Jobs</a> connection, and have really enjoyed it.  I've been meditating with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/signup?origintoken=google-b&gclid=CKCr5vC87MsCFQIKaQod-60GFA">Headspace</a> lately, and the book came along at an opportune time.  Love his descriptions of profound experiences, there's a passage <a href="http://www.crystalclarity.com/yogananda/chap14.php">here</a> that blew my mind (starting with "My body became immovably rooted")

* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Papa-Hemingway-A-Personal-Memoir/dp/0306814277">Papa Hemingway</a> - read a few Hemingways in the past, so-so, but this book has made me super curious about the guy.  Want to read his books, want to read more books about him.
