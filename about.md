Curious software developer, like to play music, listen to tons too.  Wife and I have 4 little ones, most of my time goes there.

recent Software:
--- 
* Learning a large existing .Net architecture
* Learning Rails on some existing sites.
* Dipping my toe in some clouds (AWS and Azure)
* Learning <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (yay!  You're here!)
* Truly Pair Programming for the first time in my life
* Integrated some email with <a href="https://www.mandrill.com/">Mandrill</a>

recent Music:
--- 
* <a href="http://mymorningjacket.com/releases#/release/13013">My Morning Jacket - The Waterfall</a> - I've listened to these guys in the past, and while I dug them well enough, they never crossed the threshold into a band I LOVED.  The guy's voice is a little different, and that seemed to trouble me.  However, their latest album (The Waterfall) came up on Spotify the other day, and it's hooked me.  Sounds kind of like their older stuff, but also has like a Marvin Gaye/Ween feel (falsetto?) that sticks in my brain.  I recommend a listen or two.

* <a href="http://www.thewarondrugs.net/">The War On Drugs</a> - my appreciation for this band has been coming in bigger and bigger waves over the past year.  Kind of remind me of Lindsay Buckingham/Fleetwood Mac in ways, with obvious lyrical nods to Dylan.  It sounded "lite" to me at first, but more and more I'm noticing the intricate, wailing guitar solos.  I just keep cycling through their albums.

* <a href="http://fieryfurnacesforum.com/site/">Fiery Furnaces</a> - Spotify just recommended them today, they blew my mind, and I had no idea they existed - apparently been around since 2000.  Listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow_City">Widow City</a>, which I almost skipped over because the cover looked so generic.  Looking forward to working my way through this catalog.

* <a href="http://www.flygoldeneagle.net/">Fly Golden Eagle</a> - there are songs where singer reminds me of Andrew Wood, but other songs the sound is their own.  Newest album is a double album, and I'm loving it.

* <a href="http://sturgillsimpson.com/ASGTE/?ref=https://www.google.com/">Sturgill Simpson</a> - Sturgill is the man, and his new album is about to come out.  Cannot wait.

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly">To Pimp a Butterfly</a> is musically incredible, the lyrics entertain, educate, and challenge me.  Like a modern day Funkadelic album.

recent Books:
--- 
* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain Driven Design - Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a> - This book is all about designing software (specifically, the "Model") to match the actual business process/workflow.  The "Model" here can represent a data model within a database, or the contracts defined in code, but also extend to how the "business" side of things describes operations, how things work, etc.  By using universal terminology, cohesion is introduced to the overall design and implementation processes, and end of day, the code is more likely to do what it should.  I'm enjoying the book, although I have to take it in bite sized chunks - my attention starts to drift if I read it for too long.

* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Only-Paranoid-Survive-Exploit-Challenge/dp/0385483821">Only the Paranoid Survive</a> - Andy Grove was one of the founders and CEO of Intel, and this book appears on almost every "how to succeed at business" reading lists.  In it he describes "Strategic Inflection Points", where a fundamental change can disrupt a business or industry.  When it does, it can lead either to the demise or triumph of the people and companies caught in the middle.  I'm trying to build up my business/management chops a little, and am a tech geek, so this is a very engrossing read for me.

* <a href="http://www.ananda.org/free-inspiration/books/autobiography-of-a-yogi">Autobiography of a Yogi</a> - tried this out because of the <a href="http://www.inc.com/hitendra-wadhwa/steve-jobs-self-realization-yogananda.html">Steve Jobs</a> connection, and have really enjoyed it.  I've been meditating with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/signup?origintoken=google-b&gclid=CKCr5vC87MsCFQIKaQod-60GFA">Headspace</a> lately, and the book came along at an opportune time.  Love his descriptions of profound experiences, there's a passage <a href="http://www.crystalclarity.com/yogananda/chap14.php">here</a> that blew my mind (starting with "My body became immovably rooted")

* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Papa-Hemingway-A-Personal-Memoir/dp/0306814277">Papa Hemingway</a> - read a few Hemingways in the past, so-so, but this book has made me super curious about the guy.  Want to read his books, want to read more books about him.
