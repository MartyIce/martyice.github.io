<h3>Robotics</h3>
Hello loyal blog readers!  I know you've been eagerly awaiting another post from me, I apologize for taking so long.  I had (once again) let blogging fall to the wayside, but I'm working with my son (junior in high school) learning about programming and robotics.  As part of that journey, I've encouraged him to create a jekyll blog in Github.  So what better time to dust mine off!

That's about all I've got to say for now.  Working with son on all the things, maybe will post about it here.
