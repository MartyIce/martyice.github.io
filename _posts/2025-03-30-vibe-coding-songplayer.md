<h3>Vibe Coding!</h3>
The whole world is abuzz with talk of AI, especially within the Softare industry.  And one specifically hot topic here involves Vibe Coding, where we just let AI write all the code.  We still need a human for the prompting and direction, but any old human will do.

I've used LLM prompting to generate code for a while now, but it had always been focused, with "work purpose".  However, all the Vibe Coding talk is giving me FOMO vibes, so I've taken the plunge on a few "fun" projects.  The first is functional enough that I'm ready to share it.

<h3>Toolset<h3>
My tool of choice lately has been Cursor.io.  It's agentic workflow is pretty amazing, especially when you have horsepower like claude-3.7-sonnet under the hood.  I don't have any deep and intricate secrets on prompting, but I generally try to use clarity, and specify desired architecture, frameworks, and patterns where appropriate.  Screenshots have been very beneficial with describing UI things, and I've only recently started using [mcp_playwrite][MCP Playwrite] to give the AI access to my browser.  Results have been mixed, but I have no doubt this is going to be more effective than screenshots in before long.

<h3>Guitar Tablature Player</h3>
Catchy name, eh?  I wanted the name to SPEAK to people.  It plays tabs.  For guitar.  As I typed this, however, I realized that's a pretty lame name.  I wish there was some way I could automatically spice that up a bit.

How about LLMs!?  Did I just invent Vibe Branding?!  Let's see what we can come up with - I posted the following prompt to ChatGPT and Gemini (side note, I have been using both lately, impatiently demanding best effort from each, and callously cherry-picking my preference.  One LLM glows with pride, the other calculates shame):

```
my app is currently called "Guitar Tablature Player", and it does exactly what it sounds like . However, I want to give it a more creative name for branding purposes - please give me 10 suggestions
```

Gemini:
```
Okay, here are 10 creative name suggestions for your "Guitar Tablature Player" app:

FretFlow: This evokes the smooth movement along the fretboard and the natural flow of music.
StringSync: This name implies the synchronization of guitar strings and the rhythmic aspect of playing.
AcoustiCode: This blends "acoustic" (referencing the acoustic guitar type shown in your app) with "code," highlighting the digital nature of the tablature.
TabVerse: A playful combination of "tablature" and "universe," suggesting a wide and immersive collection of tabs.
NoteWeave: This name suggests the intricate way notes and melodies are woven together in music.
PlectrumPlay: "Plectrum" is another word for a guitar pick, making this name directly related to playing the instrument.

SixStringScribe: This name directly references the six strings of a guitar and the act of writing or displaying musical notation (tablature).

Here are a few options, with StringSlinger being my top pick for a new name and Strumline as the best from your list:

Best New Name (with Alliteration):

Best Name from Your List (with Humor):

Strumline: This is a clever and humorous play on "drumline," immediately resonating with guitar players who understand the action of strumming. It's memorable and has a unique feel.
Other Strong Contenders from Your List:

FretFlow: This name is elegant and descriptive, suggesting a smooth and natural experience with the app.
ChordCanvas: This evokes a sense of creativity and visual learning, which could be appealing to guitarists.
