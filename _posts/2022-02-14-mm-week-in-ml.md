<h3>Woodshedding</h3>
It's getting boring in Marty Neural Net-ville.  Pleased with the results of slowing down, I've gone back and re-read Geron Chapter 10.  And while doing so, have begun building a [cheatsheet] of all NN things.  Never again will I be reading about a new concept, and realize I don't really know the fundamentals it's building upon!  My own little AI winter, if you will.

<h3>Upcoming Week</h3>
This past week involved note-taking on Chapter 10.  In the upcoming week, I'll be doing the same on Chapter 11.  I may get around to coding some examples, etc, but no guarantees (or pressure!)
