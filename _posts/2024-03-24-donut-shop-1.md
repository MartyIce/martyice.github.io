title: Donut Shop Part 1
tweetText: Fixing a local popular donut shop with a custom app

<h3>The Problem</h3>
Recently a new donut shop opened in my town of Mt Zion, IL.  While it's a welcome addition (Dunkin was across Decatur, only other option is Casey's), they have a flow problem.  Customers line up at the door, employees ask them their order one person at a time, the line grows.

<h3>My Solution</h3>
I think this could be solved with software.  An app similar to something like Crumbl cookie's.  Let people place their order, and just arrive to pick up the box.

<h3>My Approach</h3>
I'm going to build this as fast as possible in React, leaning on ChatGPT all the way to streamline the process.  There's alot I don't know (a big one, what the backend will look like).  Going to explore some things, and let AI on the internet help me along.

I discussed with ChatGPT, and am going to begin learning [AWS Cloud Development Kit][aws_cdk]{:target="_blank"}.  It looks like a powerful and re-usable way of building out a backend in AWS.  With it, I'll define a REST API stack that looks roughly like this:

* AWS API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* Dynamo DB

<h3>Chat GPT</h3>
I asked some intro questions from Chat GPT, mainly what to do for the backend.  It recommends AWS

</summary>

<div class="chatgpt-answer">
A fast and cost-effective way to build a backend for your React app, including web services, a database, and cloud hosting, is by leveraging serverless technologies provided by cloud service providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Here's a general approach using AWS as an example:

1. **Web Services (REST API):**
   You can use AWS API Gateway to create RESTful APIs. API Gateway allows you to define endpoints, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), authentication, and integration with other AWS services or custom backend logic.

2. **Database:**
   For the database, you can use Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. DynamoDB is scalable, highly available, and can handle large amounts of data with low latency. It's well-suited for applications that require flexible data models and high performance.

3. **Cloud Hosting:**
   You can host your backend services and database on AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can write your backend logic in Node.js, Python, Java, or other supported languages, and AWS Lambda will automatically scale it based on demand. Amazon API Gateway integrates seamlessly with Lambda to expose your APIs to the web.

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up the backend:

1. **Create REST APIs with AWS API Gateway:**
   - Define your API endpoints, such as `/inventory`, `/customers`, `/orders`.
   - Configure methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint.
   - Integrate API Gateway with Lambda functions to handle requests.

2. **Set up a Database with Amazon DynamoDB:**
   - Define tables for inventory, customers, and orders in DynamoDB.
   - Design the schema based on your application's requirements.
   - Use AWS SDKs or AWS Management Console to interact with DynamoDB.

3. **Develop Backend Logic with AWS Lambda:**
   - Write serverless functions in Node.js, Python, or any supported language.
   - Implement business logic for handling inventory, customer, and order operations.
   - Integrate Lambda functions with API Gateway to process incoming requests.

4. **Deploy and Manage Resources:**
   - Use AWS CloudFormation or AWS Management Console to deploy and manage your backend resources.
   - Monitor performance, errors, and usage metrics using AWS CloudWatch.

By following this approach, you can quickly build a scalable and cost-effective backend for your React app using serverless technologies provided by AWS. Similar services are available on other cloud platforms like Google Cloud Functions, Firebase, or Azure Functions, allowing you to choose the best fit for your project's requirements and budget.

  Is the above scalable?  ie, will Lambdas always be a good (and cheap) mechanism for maintaining REST APIs?
    </summary>
<div class="chatgpt-answer">
Yes, using AWS Lambda for maintaining REST APIs can be a scalable and cost-effective solution, especially for applications with varying traffic patterns and unpredictable workloads. Here's why Lambda can be a good choice:

1. **Scalability:** AWS Lambda automatically scales your backend resources based on incoming requests. It can handle thousands of requests per second without you needing to provision or manage servers. This makes it highly scalable and capable of handling sudden spikes in traffic without any manual intervention.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness:** With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions. Since Lambda automatically scales up and down based on demand, you're not charged for idle resources. This pay-as-you-go pricing model can be very cost-effective, especially for applications with intermittent or unpredictable usage patterns.

3. **Low Maintenance Overhead:** Lambda abstracts away server management tasks, such as provisioning, scaling, patching, and monitoring. This reduces the operational overhead and allows you to focus more on application development rather than infrastructure management.

4. **Integration with Other AWS Services:** Lambda seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and more. This enables you to build fully serverless architectures using a combination of Lambda functions and managed services, further reducing complexity and operational burden.

5. **Performance:** AWS Lambda provides low-latency execution, typically in the range of milliseconds. This ensures that your REST APIs respond quickly to client requests, providing a smooth user experience.

While Lambda is a powerful and scalable solution, it's essential to design your application architecture carefully to optimize performance and cost-effectiveness. For example, you should consider factors such as function duration, memory allocation, cold start latency, and resource utilization to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency. Additionally, monitoring and performance tuning are crucial to identifying and addressing any bottlenecks in your serverless architecture.

What's a good way to interact with DynamoDB, including schema creation maintenance, with this approach?
    </summary>
<div class="chatgpt-answer">
Interacting with DynamoDB in a serverless architecture, especially when using AWS Lambda, typically involves using AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits) or libraries that provide an abstraction layer for DynamoDB operations. Here's a recommended approach to interact with DynamoDB in a serverless environment:

1. **Use AWS SDK for Your Chosen Programming Language:**
   AWS provides SDKs for various programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, and others. You can use these SDKs to interact with DynamoDB from your Lambda functions. The SDKs provide methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and other DynamoDB operations.

2. **Define Data Models and Schemas:**
   Before interacting with DynamoDB, define your data models and schemas. Decide on the structure of your tables, including primary keys, secondary indexes, and attribute types. You can use JSON-like objects to represent your data models in your Lambda functions.

3. **Use AWS DynamoDB Document Client:**
   AWS DynamoDB Document Client is part of the AWS SDKs and provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with DynamoDB tables. It automatically marshals and unmarshals data between your Lambda functions and DynamoDB, making it easier to work with JSON documents.

4. **Create DynamoDB Tables Using AWS CloudFormation:**
   Define your DynamoDB tables as AWS CloudFormation templates. CloudFormation allows you to define infrastructure as code, including DynamoDB tables, indexes, and other resources. By defining your tables in CloudFormation templates, you can version-control your infrastructure and easily replicate it across environments.

5. **Automate Schema Creation and Maintenance:**
   You can automate schema creation and maintenance using AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). Define your table schemas in CloudFormation templates or CDK constructs, and deploy them using infrastructure as code principles. This ensures consistency and repeatability across deployments.

6. **Handle DynamoDB Throughput and Scaling:**
   Configure DynamoDB throughput settings (read and write capacity units) based on your application's workload. Monitor throughput utilization using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and auto-scaling policies. This allows DynamoDB to automatically scale up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

7. **Handle Error Handling and Retries:**
   Implement error handling and retries in your Lambda functions to handle transient failures when interacting with DynamoDB. Use exponential backoff and jitter strategies to implement retries with increasing intervals between retries.

By following these best practices, you can effectively interact with DynamoDB in a serverless architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability of your applications. Additionally, consider using AWS Lambda layers to share common code, such as data access logic and error handling, across multiple Lambda functions.
