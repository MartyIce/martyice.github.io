        <h3>The Fateful Day</h3>
<p>The past few months had been pretty rough at the candy factory.  Hell, the past few YEARS had been rough - lately it had been downright unbearable.  Aaryavir, the hero of our story, was a developer working on Dandy Candy’s marketing website.  While he used to love the work, recently he’d been in a downward spiral.  The whole company was struggling with morale.  Sales were down, negative emotions were up, and the future was bleak.  Management was starting to pound tables, looking for easy fixes, and people to blame.  Heads were starting to roll.</p>

        <h3>Welcome to 100 Days of Javascript!</h3>
<p>I’ve danced and dabbled with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript">Javascript</a> for years.  Plain old javascript, <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, along with an assortment of other frameworks.  But I still consider myself a Javascript newbie.  I know enough to be dangerous, but don’t trust myself with the “bigger decisions”.  Today I’ve decided to take the necessary steps to change this.</p>

      <h1><a href="/docker-in-azure/">Generate Searchable PDFs using Docker and Azure in 15 minutes</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Recently at <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com/" target="_blank">EarthClassMail</a> we wanted to migrate our “PDF generator” system to Azure, so I began researching our options.  There are plenty of solutions out there that create PDFs from images, but we also needed OCR results to make the PDF “searchable”.  I figured we’d be able to locate a .Net library that would do the trick.  Or possibly an affordable service that offered a cloud-based API to generate PDFs…</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>You hold an architectural idea in your head, but are struggling to communicate it.  Team members think differently about what things are called, where they live, and how they tie together.  Someone erased the whiteboard (and what was there was impossible to read a few days later anyway).  You’ve seen diagramming used in other places, but you don’t want to install some crappy tool with an impossible user interface (and what do all those symbols mean anyway?!).</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>We’ve seen the glory of App Insights.  We want the pretty charts, and all the deep tracking.  But we’re on a legacy system, not a cloud service running in Azure.  Are we forever out in the cold, looking through a window at the luxurious comfort within?</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The magic of the cloud - infrastructure on demand!  Spin up the queues, and stack up the messages!  Queues, something we used to have to manage ourselves, now forever delegated to the experts.  But we still need to track them, and know whether things are working correctly.  How to peel back that layer?</p>

<p>Thousands of items moving into and through inventory.  Wide variety of information to track.  Myriad things can go wrong.  How do we tell whether everything’s working?  How can we know when things run more slowly than usual?</p>

        <p>Last post I laid out some reasons for using <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway">AWS API Gateway</a> for creating REST services.  In this post, I’d like to walk some of the pieces involved, both within AWS, as well as some external tools that can take it to the next level.  In order to cover all the things, I’m going to paint a high level picture, with links to pages providing more detail.</p>

        <p>Ahh, to have a blog published.  Such satisfaction.  Look at me, a published author!  It wasn’t always this way, however.  Once I decided to blog, and had stockpiled a few ideas to write about, I didn’t know where to put it all.  Or how to put it there.  Vague recollections of “Blogger” and “Blogspot” crossed my mind, but I hoped things had progressed since my last foray.  Where do we go from here?</p>
